# Learn Flutter By Building a Simple Interactive App

## Title and Objectives

**Tech used:** The chosen technology for this project is Flutter, a framework that uses the Dart programming language. A programming language provides the words used to write code, while a framework provides the structure that uses those words to build applications. 
**Reason for choice:** I chose Flutter because it allows the use of a single codebase to build the same app across Android, iOS, web, and desktop platforms, which saves time, effort, and cost. 
**Objectives:** The objective of this project is to use AI as a learning aid to understand Flutter and build a simple app that displays the text “Hello Flutter” on the screen.
