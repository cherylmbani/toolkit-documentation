# Learn Flutter By Building a Simple Interactive App

## Title and Objectives

**Tech used:** The chosen technology for this project is Flutter, a framework that uses the Dart programming language. A programming language provides the words used to write code, while a framework provides the structure that uses those words to build applications.

**Reason for choice:** I chose Flutter because it allows the use of a single codebase to build the same app across Android, iOS, web, and desktop platforms, which saves time, effort, and cost. 

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to use AI as a learning aid to understand Flutter and build a simple app that displays the text “Hello Flutter” on the screen.


## Quick Summary of the Technology

Flutter is an open-source framework that was developed by Google and first released in 2018 to help developers create applications for various platforms such as mobile, web, and desktop using a single codebase.. Flutter has its own programming language named Dart, where developers can create all their application logic. All that is rendered on the screen using widgets.

Flutter is fast, easy to use even for beginners, and has a uniform appearance regardless of the device being used. Also, it has a feature called hot reload, so whatever is being coded can be seen instantly. It is popularly used by applications such as Google Pay and Alibaba.
